# Form and ajax generator from MySQL Database

The aim of this project is to simply upload a .csv file to get the structure of a form.

I've spent quite some time working on creating forms, editing databases and then readapt the forms based on the changes made. I've searched online for a solution but I couldn't find any, that's why I thought I could do it on my own.

# What it is:
This generate only a bare structure, you'll probably still need to adjust it

# What it's not
A complete solution for creating production forms
